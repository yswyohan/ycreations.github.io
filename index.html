<p>The Paradise on Earth,The Finest Island in the World - That's how Marco Polo, the famous Explorer, described Sri Lanka on his travel accounts. He set foot to Sri Lanka in 1292 CE and was one of the many famous travellers who visited the country that is called as the Pearl of the Indian Ocean.
Many of the Cultural Sites in Sri Lanka are Archeological Sites which are preserved and protected by the Sri Lankan Government with a considerable reserved land area uninhabited by people. These places are well endowed with ecologically rich scenic beauty and ancient Sri Lankan architectural monuments of traditional features. Travelling to these places takes the visitor across the country with vast changes of climatic conditions and unimaginable landscape patterns inherited to this small Island.</p>
